## **Requirements**

* Ruby- updated to version 2.6.3 is recommended
* Windows OS / Mac OS both copmatible
* Command Line access 

## **Usage (Auto)**

If you wish to manually run from the ruby executable- see "Installation-Manual" section below.

In order to run the application, ensure you're in the terminalHRM directory as downloaded onto your computer. 

And then execute:
```
$ ./terminal-hrm.sh
```



## **Installation (Manual)**

If you wish to manually run from the ruby executable- the following ruby gems must be installed on your computer:
```
gem "colorize", "~> 0.8.1"

gem "terminal-table", "~> 1.8"

gem "date_format", "~> 0.3.3"

gem "tty-prompt", "~> 0.19.0"

gem "tty-spinner", "~> 0.9.1"
```
These should already be in the Gemfile bundle, however if any one is missing, you can add each to your applications gem file like so:
```
gem 'tty-prompt'
```
Once, you have all the above gems, execute:
```
$ bundle install
```
Or install each yourself as:
```
$ gem install terminal-table
```
Once all gems have been installed, you can now start the application by executing:
```
$ ruby main-app.rb
```

# Support


## **Example Layout for YAML files to load correctly**

```
--- #is required at the top of the file
```
```
-   #is required to identify a new recording.
``` 

These indicate correct hash and array storage layouts in the yaml file to be loaded and edited correctly throughout the application.

If you would like to reset your applications database.

Initialising each file with a simple:
```
---
-
```

will allow for an empty Job listing UI to load up when starting.

Ensure all the key areas of information are included for each database. Find examples of correct yaml file layouts for each database below:
