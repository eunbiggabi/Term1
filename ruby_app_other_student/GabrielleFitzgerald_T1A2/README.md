# Interval Quiz Terminal App

## Software Development Plan - 300 - 500
Ear training is an intergral part of learning music, and being able to identify specific intervals acurately has many applications for musicians, such as playing songs by ear, being able to write down a tune they have in their head, and enhancing their understanding of music in general. The Interval Quiz terminal application will help musicicians, or anyone wanting to improve their musicianship identify the distance between notes by listening to them. 

Specifically, the applicatin will output two notes, then ask the user to input the distance between them. 

Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it


## List of Features (minimum of 3) - 100 words each

1. Two notes play, the user inputs the interval.

2. The user recieves feedback for their response. If correct, they get another question, if incorrect, they get another go (max of 3), if invalid answer, then they get another go (max of 3).

3. The user can select the difficulty of the test.

4. The user can see their progress?


## Control Flow Diagram
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
