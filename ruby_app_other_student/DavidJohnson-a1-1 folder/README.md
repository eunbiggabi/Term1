# Software Development Plan

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

- Pubcrawler - the Terminal App is designed for modern day individuals who are sophisticated, tech savvy and in constant agreement that CLI games are the bees knees - the absolute cat's pyjamas.
- This application intends to take the user on a whirlwind tour of pubs and pub culture.  By utilizing simple command line choices, it is the intention of the developers to give the user a first-hand experience of a "night on the town" with every decision having a direct effect on the health and longevity of the participant.  
- It solves the much needed problems faced by young adults these days who have "too much time on their hands".  Most need an appropriate intelectual release from harvesting bitcoin and researching cat related internet memes. 
- The intended target audience is vast in terms of numbers and complex in terms of character.  All walks of life are able to enjoy Pubcrawler - the terminal app from Boomers to yeeting gen Z's. 
- Most users will utilize personal computing devices to access this game however those with wizzard level powers will hold the ablilty to actually live and breath this without needs of digital devices.  Pubcrawler is more than a CLI game it is a way of life.  
- For those requiing computers it is a simple task of running the abovementioned bash scrip in their terminal and then yielding to the all powerful game that will no doubt ignite senses and ultimately bring about a paradigm shift in the human understanding of games, pubs and culture.


## Features

1. PLAYER STATS

The first feature one should draw their attentions to is the player stats that are visible throughout the game.  After the user chooses thier local hero, the hero's stats are displayed after each decision point to ensure the user is fully equipped with the knowledge of how the hero is fairing.  The stat's are derived from the class Hero and include a method for ending the game if the stat levels reach the stipulated thresholds.

2. GAME LOOP WITH RANDOM PUBS/STREETS and MULTIPLE CHOICE

Utilising world class coding techniques, the user is presented with a new pub, a new street and a new obstacle every time they iterate through the game loop.  By random selections from arrays and splicing the used element, this ensures the pub name, the street name and the obstacle are funky fresh on every crawl.

.3 CRAWLER MAN

A hand-crafted ASCII animation built by utilising a countown timer and looping mechanism to create a lifelike image of a hero walking towards the next drinking establishment.  Created by using Microsoft Word and a lot of time and attention this is one feature that is not to be missed! Crawlerman turns the game from a simple CLI to a fully interactive gaming masterpiece.


## User Interaction and Experience

PubCrawler - the Terminall App offers nothing less than a fully immersive experience. By simply reading the rules and utilising the keys 1, 2, 3 and 4 the user will have no trouble at all navigating and interacting with the application.  All error's will be handled within the loops and user's will feel completely at ease with how user friendly the application really is.



# TEST 1

Given the user can only use the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 with all of their selections, the result shoudl be a seamless transition trhough the gaming loop.  Test 1 showed this worked completely as expected, test two created errors due to using characters outside fo the abovementioned.  These errors will be handled internally

# TEST 2 

Given the user is able to choose their own hero, tests have been put in place to ensure each instance yields the correct results - which is the chosen starting stats (fixed for health) and a random number generated for bladder and belly.  Both tests have proven successful


# STATUS update 1

All coding is going according to plan.  Amount of pubs has been reduced from 10 to 5 due to the scope.  Most of the functionality will remain constant - there have been a few bugs noted but will be ironed out with further development

# STATUS update 2

Major refactoring has occured to increase functionality of the pplication.  Additional classes have been created as well as additional arrays. Controller file has been split into smaller files.
